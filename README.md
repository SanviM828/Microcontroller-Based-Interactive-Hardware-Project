# Microcontroller-Based-Interactive-Hardware-Project

**Status:** Ongoing (Aug'25 – Present)

This repository documents an ongoing self-project focused on developing an **interactive embedded system prototype**.  
The project explores the integration of **synchronized LED light patterns, audio effects, and motor-driven actuation** to simulate dynamic real-time behavior.

Originally inspired by interactive prop (Flame Chompers) from entertainment media (Arcane series), this project aims to reimagine such concepts through an engineering and embedded systems perspective.
